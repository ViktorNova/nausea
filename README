# spectrum

This is a simple audio spectrum visualizer.  It works well with the mpd
music player daemon.  It was originally inspired by the visualizer
screen of ncmpcpp.  It depends on the fftw3 and curses libraries.

You need to add the following to your mpd.conf.  The format is important
because it's the only one supported for now.

    audio_output {
        type "fifo"
        name "Pipe"
        path "/tmp/audio.fifo"
        format "44100:16:2"
    }

Then start spectrum with:

    $ spectrum

Alternatively specify the path of your mpd fifo with:

    $ spectrum <path-to-fifo>

To try out spectrum with color support try:

    $ xterm -bg black -fa "Monospace:pixelsize=12" -e ./spectrum -c
