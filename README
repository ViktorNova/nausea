# spectrum

This is a simple spectrum visualizer for the mpd music daemon.  It was
originally inspired by the visualizer screen of ncmpcpp.  It depends on
the fftw3 and curses libraries.

You need to add the following to your mpd.conf.  The format is important
because it's the only one supported for now.

    audio_output {
        type "fifo"
        name "Pipe"
        path "~/.mpd/mpd.fifo"
        format "44100:16:1"
    }

Then start spectrum with:

    $ spectrum ~/.mpd/mpd.fifo

Enjoy!
