# nausea

This is a simple audio spectrum visualizer.  It works well with the mpd
music player daemon, as well as anything that can play or record audio to stdout.

It was originally inspired by the visualizer
screen of ncmpcpp.  It depends on the fftw3 and curses libraries.

To visualize system audio, you must first make a fifo using mkfifo, and then use
something like aplay or arecord to redirect audio into your fifo:

````
mkfifo /tmp/audio.fifo
aplay > /tmp/audio.fifo
````

You need to add the following to your mpd.conf.  The format is important
because it's the only one supported for now.

    audio_output {
        type "fifo"
        name "Pipe"
        path "/tmp/audio.fifo"
        format "44100:16:2"
    }

Then start the program with:

    $ nausea

Alternatively specify the path of your mpd fifo with:

    $ nausea <path-to-fifo>

To try it out with color support try:

    $ xterm -bg black -fa "Monospace:pixelsize=12" -e ./nausea -c
